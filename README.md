# EssentialAPI
EssentialAPI is an API that add's all the functions for SCP SL coding in an easier way!

# How do I put it in my project?
Adding the API in simple just go to dependecies -> add from -> your dll path.

# The API is compatible for Exiled and LabAPI?
Yes, you can work on Exiled or in LabAPI it's just make easier the coding!
BUT it's important that the file is in the LabAPI plugins folder and NOT in the
Exiled one.

# What Are the functions?
Here are all the functions:
FEATURES:
- CustomLog system
- Server Managment
- Spawner of schematics (with Project MER)
- Timing
PLAYER:
- CustomBroadcast

- Teleport

This is the first release of the plugin, there are not so many functions but later on I'm going to
work on this, contact me on discord if you want a specific function to add! (Discord: @florentina_rossi)
